Handel, Georg Frideric
01. Israel in Egypt - Overture
02. Israel in Egypt - Now there arose a new king over Egypt
03. Israel in Egypt - And the children of Israel sigh'd
04. Israel in Egypt - Then sent he Moses
05. Israel in Egypt - They loathed to drink of the river
06. Israel in Egypt - Their land brought forth frogs
07. Israel in Egypt - He spake the word
08. Israel in Egypt - He gave them hailstones for rain
09. Israel in Egypt - He sent a thick darkness
10. Israel in Egypt - He smote all the first born of Egypt
11. Israel in Egypt - But as for his people
12. Israel in Egypt - He rebuked the Red Sea
13. Israel in Egypt - And Israel saw that great work
14. Israel in Egypt - Moses and the children of Israel
15. Israel in Egypt - The Lord is my strength and my song
