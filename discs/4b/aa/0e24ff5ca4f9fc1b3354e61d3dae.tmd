07. Does this music sound like The New World to you?
08. We come now to the 2nd movement, which has a charming melody
09. The 3rd movement is a marvel of ingenuity and deftness
10. And now the last movement. In general I should say that this is the most Slavic of all
11. The final claim of those who argue for The New World Symphony as American music
