01. Elijah - Hear ye, Israel
02. Elijah - Be not afraid, saith God the Lord
03. Elijah - The Lord hath exalted thee from among the people
04. Elijah - Woe to him! He shall perish
05. Elijah - Man of God, now let my words be precious in thy sight
06. Elijah - It is enough! O Lord, now take away my life
07. Elijah - See, now he sleepeth beneath a juniper tree
08. Elijah - Lift thine eyes to the mountains
09. Elijah - He, watching over Israel
10. Elijah - Arise, Elijah, for thou hast a long journey before thee
11. Elijah - Oh rest in the Lord
12. Elijah - He that shall endure to the end, shall be saved
13. Elijah - Night falleth round me, o Lord!
14. Elijah - Behold, God the Lord passed by!
15. Elijah - Above him stood the Seraphim. Holy is God the Lord Sabaoth
16. Elijah - Go, return upon thy way!
17. Elijah - For the mountains shall depart
18. Elijah - Then did Elijah the prophet break forth like a fire
19. Elijah - Then shall the righteous shine forth
20. Elijah - Behold, God hath sent Elijah the prophet
21. Elijah - But the Lord from the north hath raised one. Oh come everyone that thirsteth
22. Elijah - And then shall your light break forth
