music: morten klein, lyrics: tokunbo akinro
01. it took so long
02. the weight
03. like music from the skies
04. secrets of the night
05. nothing stays the same
06. i cannot sleep
07. a day in the life
08. something restless
09. spooky
10. can you keep it?
11. when you're far away
  Frank Fiedler, double bass
  Ritchie Staringer, electric piano [Rhodes]
