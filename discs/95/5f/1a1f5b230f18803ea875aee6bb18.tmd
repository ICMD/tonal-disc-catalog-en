Alfred Schnittke
Schnittke: Psalms of Repentance
  01.   I. Adam sat weeping at the gates of paradise
  02.  II. O wilderness, gather me to your silent and gentle lap
  03. III. That is why I live in poverty
  04.  IV. My soul, why are you in a state of sin?
  05.   V. O Man, doomed and wretched
  06.  VI. When they beheld the ship that suddenly came
  07. VII. Oh my soul, why are you not afraid
  08. VIII. If you wish to overcome unending sorrow
  09.  IX. I have reflected on my life as a monk
  10.   X. Christian people, gather together!
  11.  XI. I entered this life of tears a naked infant

12. XII. [wordless humming]

Arvo P鋜t
13. P鋜t: Magnificat
