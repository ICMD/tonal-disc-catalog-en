01. All of you
02. Sometimes I'm happy
03. You took advantage of me
04. When it's sleepy time down south
05. There'll be some changes made
06. 'Deed I do
07. Don't worry 'bout me
08. All the way
09. Just one more chance
10. It's not for me to say
11. I'll never smile again
12. Baby, won't you please come home
  Billie Holiday
