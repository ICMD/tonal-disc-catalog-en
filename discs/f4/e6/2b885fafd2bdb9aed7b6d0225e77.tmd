01. Israel in Egypt - He is my God
02. Israel in Egypt - The Lord is a man of war
03. Israel in Egypt - The depths have covered them
04. Israel in Egypt - Thy right hand, o Lord
05. Israel in Egypt - And with the blast of thy nostrils
06. Israel in Egypt - The enemy said: I will pursue
07. Israel in Egypt - Thou didst blow with the wind
08. Israel in Egypt - Who is like unto thee?
09. Israel in Egypt - The people shall hear and be afraid
10. Israel in Egypt - Thou shalt bring them in
11. Israel in Egypt - The Lord shall reign
12. Israel in Egypt - For the horse of Pharaoh
13. Israel in Egypt - The Lord shall reign
14. Israel in Egypt - And Miriam, the prophetess
15. Israel in Egypt - Sing ye to the Lord
